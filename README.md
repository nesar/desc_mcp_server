# desc-mcp-server

MCP server exposing the public **LSST DESC** cosmology stack as agent tools:
[CCL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL) theory predictions,
[sacc](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/sacc) data vectors,
[firecrown](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown) likelihoods,
[augur](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/augur) Fisher forecasts,
[TXPipe](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/TXPipe) measurement pipelines,
[TJPCov](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/TJPCov) covariances,
[NaMaster](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster) pseudo-C_ell measurements and
[Smokescreen](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Smokescreen) data-vector concealment — 54
tools in ten families, with server-side skills for the multi-tool pipelines
and optional execution of the heavy steps on ALCF Polaris / NERSC Perlmutter
through the [hep-genesis](https://github.com/HEP-KE/hep-genesis-agent)
dispatch engine.

The upstream packages are used **unmodified** (they are read-only reference
clones next to this repo); every line of glue lives here, so the DESC codes
can keep evolving underneath.

Companion documents:
- [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md) — how the single `desc-mcp` Python
  environment is assembled, the version pins and why, why TXPipe lives
  elsewhere, and the facility environments a user can choose
- [`notes/DESIGN.md`](notes/DESIGN.md) — the design decisions, with the
  package surveys that back them in `notes/survey_*.md`

## Quick start

```bash
bash scripts/env.sh                       # micromamba + .mcp-env/ from tools/env/conda-lock.yml (~5 min), then 10 env checks
.mcp-env/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q       # in-process tool tests
.mcp-env/bin/python tests/smoke_server.py     # every family through a live MCP session
.mcp-env/bin/python -m mcp_server             # stdio transport
.mcp-env/bin/python -m mcp_server --transport streamable-http --port 8000   # HTTP
```

No conda needed: the environment is the exact set of versions in
`tools/env/conda-lock.yml` (source: `tools/env/environment.yml`; change it and
run `bash scripts/env.sh --relock`). The same lock ships inside the dispatch
pack and is built on the compute node, so what runs here runs there.

Register with Claude Code / Claude Desktop (stdio, local):

```bash
claude mcp add desc -- $(pwd)/.mcp-env/bin/python -m mcp_server
```

(Claude Desktop: add the same command and args to `claude_desktop_config.json`,
with `"cwd"` set to this directory.) Or point any MCP client — including the
hep-genesis-agent desktop app's server list — at the HTTP endpoint
(`http://host:8000/mcp`).

## Tool families

| Family | Tools | Backed by |
|---|---|---|

| sacc | `sacc_inspect`, `sacc_to_csv`, `sacc_prepare_for_firecrown`, `sacc_attach_gaussian_covariance` | sacc 2.4 (+ pyccl for the Gaussian covariance) |
| firecrown | `firecrown_list_examples`, `firecrown_build_likelihood`, `firecrown_compute_loglike`, `firecrown_theory_data_vector`, `firecrown_scan_loglike`, `firecrown_run_chain`, `firecrown_chain_status`, `firecrown_plot_chain`, `firecrown_chain_cancel` | firecrown 1.16 factory API, Cobaya (pure-CCL mode; background runs, resume, auto-PPF for w0-wa), getdist corner plots |
| augur | `augur_list_examples`, `augur_generate_forecast_config`, `augur_validate_forecast_config`, `augur_generate_synthetic_datavector`, `augur_compute_fisher`, `augur_plot_fisher_contours` | augur 1.2.4 (+ TJPCov, numdifftools / derivkit) |
| txpipe | `txpipe_list_stages`, `txpipe_describe_stage`, `txpipe_list_examples`, `txpipe_generate_pipeline`, `txpipe_validate_pipeline`, `txpipe_run_pipeline`, `txpipe_run_status`, `txpipe_fetch_example_data` | TXPipe source (read as metadata) + ceci; runs in a separate TXPipe env or on a facility |
| tjpcov | `tjpcov_list_covariance_types`, `tjpcov_generate_config`, `tjpcov_compute_covariance`, `tjpcov_compare_covariances` | tjpcov 0.5.1: Gaussian f_sky (harmonic and real space), halo-model SSC and cNG terms; NaMaster-coupled types need NaMaster 2.x (facility env) |
| namaster | `namaster_mask_properties`, `namaster_simulate_maps`, `namaster_compute_cls` | pymaster 3.0 + healpy: masks, simulated Gaussian maps from CCL theory, pseudo-C_ell bandpowers -> sacc with windows and coupled noise |

| dispatch | `set_dispatch`, `get_dispatch`, `auth_status`, `export_dispatch_pack` | hep-genesis engine (IRI + Globus) |

Conventions every tool follows: redshift `z` at the boundary (never scale
factor); `k` in h/Mpc and P(k) in (Mpc/h)^3 unless a tool's `k_units` says
otherwise; `theta` in arcmin; parameter names are firecrown's (`Omega_c`,
`Omega_b`, `h`, `n_s`, `sigma8` or `A_s`, `w0`, `wa`, `m_nu`; nuisance
`src0_delta_z`, `lens0_bias`, `ia_bias`, ...). One `cosmology` object (with
presets `vanilla`, `planck18`, `desc_srd`) is accepted by every family. Files,
not arrays, flow between tools; every file-writing tool takes `output_dir`
and returns `{status, files, message, metadata}`.

## Skills (server-side, client-agnostic)

The server carries its own skills — named multi-tool recipes in
[`skills/`](skills/) (markdown with a small frontmatter header), served both
through `list_desc_skills` / `load_desc_skill` and as native MCP prompts.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `desc-tour` | one representative call per family; the five-minute demo path |
| `ccl-datavector-to-sacc` | SRD n(z) → angular C_ell (Limber / non-Limber) → sacc file ready for firecrown |
| `pk-ccl-vs-emulators` | CCL nonlinear P(k) across prescriptions vs the companion emulator server, one k grid |
| `likelihood-sanity-checks` | inspect → build → loglike at fiducial → 1-D scan, with the chi2/dof and parameter-completeness checks that must pass before any chain |
| `txpipe-sacc-to-likelihood` | take a TXPipe sacc (tracers `source_i/lens_i`, maybe no covariance) to a firecrown likelihood |
| `txpipe-measurement` | compose, validate and run a TXPipe 3x2pt pipeline (local env or facility) |
| `lsst-3x2pt-forecast` | augur Y1/Y10 Fisher forecast end to end, plausible numbers, pitfalls |
| `maps-to-likelihood` | masked maps (or a simulated test bed) -> NaMaster bandpowers with windows -> TJPCov covariance -> firecrown chi2, with the binning/noise cross-checks |
| `conceal-datavector` | Smokescreen concealment protocol: validate the likelihood, choose ranges and a seed, conceal, record, encrypt the original, analyse the concealed file |
| `hpc-dispatch-handoff` | run the heavy kernels on ALCF/NERSC through the client's hep-genesis facility tools |

## Example queries

Try these from the hep-genesis-agent desktop app or Claude Desktop with the
server registered. Each maps to one family or one skill; the last ones need a

### Heavy jobs for NERSC Perlmutter / ALCF Polaris

These run for tens of minutes to hours on a compute node and need a facility
sign-in on the client plus a facility environment for the DESC stack
(`env_setup`; on NERSC the `desc-python` or `desc-cosmology` stacks, on ALCF an
environment you built from `desc-cosmology-env` — see `ENVIRONMENT.md`).
Every chain, forecast and pipeline below goes through `export_dispatch_pack`
(hosted server) or `set_dispatch` (server on your own machine); the tools
report the host they ran on. Heavy tools take an explicit walltime
(`walltime_s` on chains, `duration_s` on forecasts, `walltime_s` on TXPipe
runs); the hep-genesis engine routes jobs over the debug cap (Perlmutter
30 min, Polaris 60 min) to the long queue by itself and rejects durations no
queue admits before staging. A chain that stops at its walltime is continued
with `resume=True` and the same arguments. While a heavy call waits for a
facility job it sends MCP progress heartbeats (every `MCP_HEARTBEAT_S`,
default 30 s), so clients that reset their request timeout on progress keep
the call alive; a long LOCAL chain should use `background=True` and be
polled with `firecrown_chain_status`, then summarised with
`firecrown_plot_chain`.

12. **MCMC** — *"Build the firecrown likelihood for the DES Y1 3x2pt test data vector, check chi2/dof at the fiducial point, then run a Cobaya chain on Perlmutter with the desc-python environment sampling Omega_c, sigma8, w0, wa, h, n_s and the five lens biases with uniform priors, max_samples 20000 and R-1 < 0.02. Report whether it converged, the means and 68% intervals, and the trace plot."* (`firecrown_run_chain`; a `max_samples` of 200 is the local smoke run)
13. **Same chain on ALCF** — *"Export the dispatch pack and run the same chain on Polaris under my environment at `/eagle/<project>/<user>/envs/desc-cosmology`; compare the posterior means and R-1 with the Perlmutter run and confirm both hosts."*
14. **Chain on a TXPipe measurement** — *"Take the `twopoint_data_real.sacc` from the TXPipe run, prepare it for firecrown, attach a Gaussian covariance with f_sky=0.05, sigma_e=0.26, n_gal=10 per arcmin², verify chi2/dof at Planck 2018, then run a 10000-sample chain in Omega_c, sigma8 and w0 on Perlmutter."* (`txpipe-sacc-to-likelihood` skill, then `firecrown_run_chain`)
15. **Big Fisher forecast** — *"Generate an LSST Y10 3x2pt forecast config with the TJPCov covariance and the CAMB transfer function, varying Omega_c, Omega_b, sigma8, h, n_s, w0, wa, m_nu, all ten lens biases, the IA amplitude and the five source delta_z shifts with the SRD photo-z priors; validate it, run augur_compute_fisher on Perlmutter with a 4-hour walltime, and report the marginalised errors and the w0–wa FoM with and without the priors."* (41 full theory-vector evaluations with CAMB)
16. **Derivative-step study** — *"Repeat the Y10 Fisher on Polaris with derivative steps of 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5% and tell me how stable the w0–wa FoM is; flag any non-positive-definite result."*
17. **Full TXPipe pipeline** — *"Compose a TXPipe 3x2pt_fourier pipeline for the 20 deg² DC2 metadetect catalog at `$CFS/<project>/<user>/txpipe/data`, nside 2048, five source and five lens bins; validate it, run it on Perlmutter with 128 threads and a 6-hour walltime under my TXPipe environment, then inspect the resulting sacc and give me the per-stage status."* (`txpipe_run_pipeline` keeps the HDF5 catalogs and maps on the facility and returns the sacc, PNGs and log tails)
18. **Likelihood profiles in batch** — *"For w0 = -1.2, -1.0 and -0.8, scan the DES Y1 3x2pt log-likelihood in sigma8 between 0.65 and 0.95 with 200 points each on Perlmutter, and report how the 1-sigma interval in sigma8 shifts with w0."* (three dispatched `firecrown_scan_loglike` jobs)
19. **Large CCL grid (pip-kernel, no DESC environment needed)** — *"On Polaris, compute the non-Limber 3x2pt angular power spectra for the LSST Y10 SRD bins (5 source + 10 lens, ell 2–5000) with the CAMB transfer function and HMcode-2020 baryons on a 5×5 grid of (w0, wa), and report the largest Limber-vs-non-Limber fractional difference per bin pair at ell < 100."*
20. **Cross-facility check** — *"Run the Y1 Fisher forecast with the SRD covariance on both Perlmutter and Polaris, confirm the hosts, and show that the marginalised errors agree to better than 1%."*

## Design principles

- **Packages untouched**: nothing under `CCL/`, `CCLX/`, `TXPipe/`,
  `firecrown/`, `augur/` or `external/` (TJPCov, NaMaster, Smokescreen, sacc,
  ceci, ...) is modified; the server reads them (example data, n(z) tables,
  stage metadata) and installs them from copies. Upstream quirks are worked
  around in the server (e.g. TJPCov's real-space block ordering, NaMaster
  windows vs TJPCov's f_sky binning), never patched in the clones.
- **One cosmology object, firecrown's names**: the same `cosmology` JSON
  feeds CCL, firecrown and augur; `convert_cosmology_names` translates to
  Cobaya, CosmoSIS and the emulator server.
- **sacc is the contract between families**: TXPipe writes it, CCL and augur
  generate it, firecrown reads it. `sacc_prepare_for_firecrown` bridges the
  one naming mismatch (TXPipe `source_i/lens_i` vs firecrown `src{i}/lens{i}`).
- **Compose, validate, then run**: every heavy step is preceded by
  millisecond-scale validation (YAML, parameter completeness, DAG checks) so a
  bad request never costs queue time.
- **Kernel/wrapper split**: heavy computations live in kernels that are
  JSON-safe and runnable on a facility node; wrappers handle files, labels,
  plots and metadata wherever the server runs.
- **Files, not arrays**: CSV / sacc / PNG artifacts with provenance headers;
  only paths and quotable summaries pass through the LLM context.

## Hosting

Same recipe as the other HEP-KE servers (a Linux box behind a reverse proxy):

1. Clone, run `bash scripts/env.sh` (micromamba + `.mcp-env/` from the lock; no
   conda on the box), keep the reference clones next to the repo (or point
   `DESC_*_DIR` at them).
2. Run `.mcp-env/bin/python -m mcp_server --transport streamable-http` under
   systemd bound to localhost — `deploy/desc-mcp.service.example` is a
   complete unit — with `MCP_PUBLIC=1`, `MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT=/srv/artifacts`,
   `MCP_ARTIFACT_URL=https://files.example.org`.
3. TLS reverse proxy in front: one route to the server port, one static file
   server on `MCP_OUTPUT_ROOT`.
4. After every deploy: `python tests/smoke_server.py <url>`.

The hosted server needs **no** facility sign-in, project, or environment
settings and ships no example data; see the next section.

## Run on HPC

All facility access goes through the hep-genesis dispatch engine (IRI for
job submission, Globus Transfer or the IRI filesystem API for staging and
results). This server writes no batch scripts, opens no SSH sessions, and
holds no facility identity: project, workdir, tokens, Globus endpoint and
the facility-side software environment are the **user's**, supplied by the
client per call.

**Client-side dispatch (hosted deployments — recommended).** `export_dispatch_pack`
returns the `tools/` kernels plus a manifest. The client's hep-genesis
facility server runs them with `run_pack_kernel` under the user's
credentials. Two kernel kinds:

| Kind | Used by | Node needs |
|---|---|---|
| lock-kernel (default) | every `inner.*` script: firecrown loglike/scan/chain, augur forecast; `ccl_*` grids | nothing: the pack carries `env/conda-lock.yml` and the engine builds that environment on the node with micromamba (first job per lock: minutes; reused afterwards) |
| env-kernel (override) | the same scripts when the user passes `env_setup`; TXPipe pipelines always | a facility-resident environment named by the user in `env_setup` |

The manifest carries `env_lock` (the path of the lock inside the pack) and
still lists public `env_setup` candidates for the override — on NERSC the
DESC `desc-cosmology` stack (`source $CFS/lsst/groups/MCP/setup-cosmology.sh`)
or `desc-python`; on ALCF a user-built environment from `desc-cosmology-env`.
The `hpc-dispatch-handoff` skill walks an agent through it.

**Server-side dispatch (server on your own machine).** With
`pip install -e <hep-genesis-agent>/backend[iri]` in the env and a facility
sign-in, `set_dispatch("perlmutter")` makes the heavy tools dispatch
themselves; env-kernel tools take `env_setup` as an argument. Do not use this
mode on shared deployments.
