"""Optional HPC dispatch: run this server's compute kernels on DOE facilities.

Local execution is the default and is untouched by this module. Two modes
(identical to the cosmic-emulator / spectra / gaia servers):

CLIENT-SIDE (hosted deployments - recommended): this server holds NO
credentials, project, workdir or facility environment. export_dispatch_pack
hands the tools/ kernels to the client, and the client's hep-genesis harness
- which owns the facility tokens, Globus endpoint, project and workdir -
stages and submits them itself over IRI + Globus (facility-server
run_pack_kernel tool / sidecar POST /jobs pack=). A VM deployment needs
nothing beyond this server.

SERVER-SIDE (running the server on your own machine): set_dispatch("polaris"
| "perlmutter") routes the heavy tools through the hep-genesis dispatch
engine in THIS process: the tools/ package is staged to the facility over
Globus (or the IRI filesystem API on NERSC), the kernel runs on a compute
node, and results come back. Facility settings (project, workdir, tokens)
come from the USER's hep-genesis .env and sign-in - never from this server.
Do not use server-side mode on shared/hosted deployments.

Two kernel styles ship in the pack:
- pip-kernels (tools/ccl/kernels.py): pure pyccl, node-side deps installed
  by the engine from pip (`pyccl`, `camb` wheels).
- env-kernels (tools/envkernel.py + tools/inner/*): everything that needs the
  conda-only DESC stack (firecrown, augur, TXPipe). The kernel runs under the
  facility's module python and launches the inner script under an
  environment the CLIENT names in the `env_setup` argument (public candidates
  are listed in the manifest; nothing is chosen by the server).

No SLURM/PBS scripts and no SSH anywhere: the engine generates the job
wrapper and submits it through the IRI compute API.

Tool names (set_dispatch, get_dispatch, auth_status, export_dispatch_pack)
are a cross-server convention matched by name in the hep-genesis harness -
do not rename them.
